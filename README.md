# SvelteKit-Lucia-Starter

SvelteKit-Lucia-Starter is a SvelteKit starter project that includes all the functionality that I like. It is kind of like the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) in some ways as it includes a similar feature set.

Includes the following features:

- Sveltekit installed and configured
- [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) for authentication (configured to have a username / password authentication).
- Login / Logout Pages (using Lucia), including redirect to login page on attempt to access authenticated page.
- Protected routes
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to provide database (includes a SQLite schema for authentication / session management)
- [SvelteKit-Superforms](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) for validation of actions, and all the other features provided by this library.
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), which is used for form and trpc validation.
- [TRPC](https://trpc.io/) with [TRPC-Sveltekit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit) to provide a centralised set of functions for use through the application. The TRPC router is setup to allow for protected functions (with incuded demonstrations)
- A working staged DockerFile and docker-compose file are provided.
- Vitest is included, however there are no tests setup and functioning
- TailwindCSS is _NOT_ included, however the tempalte has been tested to work with svelte-add to add tailwind.

## Getting started

To get started with SvelteKit-Lucia-Starter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qwacko/sveltekit-lucia-starter.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd sveltekit-lucia-starter
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create a new Prisma migration:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Production

This template is tested to work with Docker using the provided Dockerfile. It possibly may work with a service such as Vercel or Netlify, however there may be significant changes (Prisma, Sveltekit Adapter, Auth Library Crypto etc..) and I haven't tested it.

Recommendation is to stick with Docker (or possibly node) unless you are knowledgable in the environment you are planning on deploying to.

## Envinroment Variables

The following environemnt variables are included
| Variable | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|ORIGIN| Used In Production Only. Indicates the origin for all node routing to work correctly|
|DATABASE_URL|Set the database URL. Used in both dev and production.|
|HTTPS|Sets whether the authentication cookie in production will be secure (require HTTPS) or not. A value of anything other than "TRUE" (or blank) will result in insecure cookies. No effect in dev|

## Auth

Auth is handled by the `lucia-auth` library with the following information to guide the user of this template:

- Route guards have been implemented in the `hooks.server.ts` file rather than elsewhere. With the folder structure (seperate sections for `loggedIn`, `loggedOut`, and `open`) this makes it relativelt easy to guard specific sections of the app. These route guards are used to redirect on login and logout.
- TRPC has a auth guard middleware as well (`lib/server/trpc/middleware/auth.ts`) that can be added to any TRPC endpoint that needs an authorised user to access. It will throw an unauthorised error if a user trys to access the endpoint.
- If you want the user information to be displayed on the page, then look at how the load function in `routes/(loggedIn)/user/+page.server.ts` are used to provide this information to the frontend.

## Tailwind

To keep the template as clean and widely useable as possible, Tailwind (or any other styling library) is not included.

In order to add tailwind, simple run the following command after cloning this repository:

`npx svelte-add@latest tailwindcss`

## Prisma

The prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` is setup to only have enough configuration to allow for the user and session storage.
If the DB type is changed, then the migrations folder will need to be deleted / removed.

## Docker

A DockerFile has been created, that is a staged build (to reduce the final file size). A couple of things to consider:

- There is a `deps` stage and a `proddeps` stage, the "proddeps" will only install production dependencies to reduce final image size.
- The `docker-compose-example.yml` can be used as a starting point for a docker-compose file that should work.
- the `dockerEntrypoint.sh` script is used to perform prisma database migrations on startup prior to starting the image.

## TRPC

TRPC has been setup in a way that can be used as part of teh frontend, backend, actions, load functions etc.. by using `trpc-sveltekit` library. Check out the documentatino on that library to understand how the configuration works.

- Most of the TRPC server is prevented from being called from teh frontend by being located in a `server` directory. The exception to this is the frontend client (for use on `+page.svelte` and `+page.ts`) which is outside of this folder to allow for calling from the frontend.
- As per the Auth section, there is an auth middleware to check the user has been provided. This is useful as a backstop to make sure that only authorised users can access specific TRPC endpoints regardless of where tehy are called from (Frontend or Server).
- Examples of how to use the TRPC router are provided in the `routes/(loggedIn)/user` page. With `+page.svelte` indicating a trpc query from the page, `+page.ts` indicating a load function, `+page.server.ts` showing how to call is on the server. With these different calling methods all application should be achievable.
- It is possible that an app could be configured to route all queries and mutations through TRPC for consistency regardless of where the call is coming from. Alternatiely TRPC could be removed entirely from the applicaiton, and rely on actions / load functions. It is up to the dev.

## Scripts

- `build`: Build the project for production
- `preview`: Preview the production build locally
- `test:unit`: Run unit tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- `lint`: Run Prettier and ESLint
- `format`: Run Prettier to format the code

```
